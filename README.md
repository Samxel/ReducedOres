**Too many ores cluttering your world?**  
Reduced Ores is a lightweight and highly compatible mod that lowers ore generation to bring back balance, challenge, and meaning to mining.

---

## 🔻 Features


- 📉 **Reduces ore spawn rates** across all dimensions
- 🔘 **Shrinks ore vein size** (blob size) to avoid massive ore clusters
- ⚙️ **Fully configurable** via the mod’s config file — tweak rates and sizes
- 🔄 **Works seamlessly** with vanilla and modded ores from dozens of mods

---

## 💡 Perfect For

- Players who want a more **survival-focused** or **hardcore mining** experience
- Reducing **resource overflow** in large or exploration-heavy modpacks
- Making every ore vein feel **rewarding, not redundant**

---

## 🧩 Compatibility

- Works with most worldgen mods (e.g. `Terralith`, `BetterNether`, `Create`, `AllTheOres`, etc.)
- **Does not override** loot tables or structure data — stays focused and modular

---

## 📦 Why Reduced Ores?

- **Lightweight**
- **Configurable**
- **Focused**

> Every ore should feel like a discovery — not a given.
